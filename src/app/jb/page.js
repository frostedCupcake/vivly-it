              dedication, and perseverance. Despite numerous challenges, she
              qualified as a Chartered Accountant to support our family. Her

              Building on these foundational lessons, I stepped into my first
              year of college on November 21, 2022, with my inaugural class:
              Introduction to Programming in C. Initially, I wanted to stay
              ahead of the instructor just to better understand the course
              material. To achieve this, I watched tutorials and practiced
              problems every single day. I fell in love with the journey and the
              progress I was making. I accelerated my learning and finished the
              entire syllabus in just two weeks.
            </li>
            <li>
              After that, I started learning Python by making games and
              automating boring processes. By doing so aided me in understanding
              python as a language and also foundation to start my journey in
              deep learning. I then gradually shifted my focus to understand the
              mathamatics behind them. This was fun until I built something
              interesting but I couldn't show it to anyone as I could only
              interact with it through a terminal. I needed a way to bring my
              ideas to people.
            </li>
            <li>
              That's how I got into Web development. I dedicated countless hours
              to mastering the fundamentals of frontend development. I refined
              my skills to the point where translating ideas into elegant
              websites. Later, I've explored Backend and DevOps, where I enjoyed
              system design, building cloud architectures, and optimizing
              backend systems to scale applications efficiently. What started as
              a necessity quickly became another passion.

                I must say it was at IITH I realized the true potential of
                technology. I became actively involved in several technological
                clubs and contributed to a variety of projects. I wanted to to
                get a taste of IoT development so I worked hands on with
                arduino, microcontrollors and various sensors. Notably, I worked
                on cool hardware projects involving gestures to communicate
                wirelessly with various devices. Firstly, a gesture controlled
                car and secondly, AI powered gesture recoginition system

              capable of capturing atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ and rapidly converting it
              into limestone. I was blown away when I realized the potential of
              this field to radically transform the world and improve people's
              lives.

              This discovery propelled me to explore microbial mechanisms for
              atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ capture. Despite their promising impact on the
              climate, many startups in this sphere struggle to scale due to
              capital constraints. I see an opportunity to change that by
              helping them generate carbon credits for every ton of CO‚ÇÇ they
              mitigate, using tools that quantify CO‚ÇÇ sequestration. This
              realization drives me to delve deeper into genetics and systems
              biology, determined to do whatever it takes to turn this concept
              into reality.

              Despite never meeting in person, our friendship grew stronger
              while working together. I stayed in touch with him even while
              working on Picapool. It was during this time that my
              entrepreneurial passion ignited, and I conveyed to Viv my intent
              to start something new‚Äîsomething he was excited to be a part of.
              We discussed my interest in sustainability, explored other
              potential fields for innovation, and brainstormed ideas. Our
              ideation sessions, combined with an open offer from a carbon

              credit market and the sustainability policies of nations globally.
