              A wise man once said, ‚ÄúYour passion is not something you find;

              your soul come alive.‚Äù

              Which led me to gain substantial experience through numerous

              curiosity led me to dive deeper, turning fleeting interests into
              lasting expertise. I not only honed my technical skills but also
              developed a deep appreciation for how technology drives modern
              businesses forward.

              qualified as a Chartered Accountant to support our family. Her

              Building on these foundational lessons, I stepped into my first
              year of college on November 21, 2022, with my inaugural class:
              Introduction to Programming in C. Initially, I wanted to stay
              ahead of the instructor just to better understand the course
              material. To achieve this, I watched tutorials and practiced
              problems every single day. I fell in love with the journey and the
              progress I was making. I accelerated my learning and finished the
              entire syllabus in just two weeks.
            </li>
            <li>
              After that, I started learning Python by making games and
              automating boring processes. By doing so aided me in understanding
              python as a language and also foundation to start my journey in
              deep learning. I then gradually shifted my focus to understand the
              mathamatics behind them. This was fun until I built something
              interesting but I couldn't show it to anyone as I could only
              interact with it through a terminal. I needed a way to bring my
              ideas to people.
            </li>
            <li>
              That's how I got into Web development. I dedicated countless hours
              to mastering the fundamentals of frontend development. I refined
              my skills to the point where translating ideas into elegant
              websites. Later, I've explored Backend and DevOps, where I enjoyed
              system design, building cloud architectures, and optimizing
              backend systems to scale applications efficiently. What started as
              a necessity quickly became another passion.

                technology. I became actively involved in several technological
                clubs and contributed to a variety of projects. I wanted to to
                get a taste of IoT development so I worked hands on with
                arduino, microcontrollors and various sensors. Notably, I worked
                on cool hardware projects involving gestures to communicate
                wirelessly with various devices. Firstly, a gesture controlled
                car. Secondly, AI powered gesture recoginition system utilizing
                motion sensors where we capture and analyse data from a Google

              Despite never meeting in person, our friendship grew stronger
              while working together. I stayed in touch with him even while
              working on Picapool. It was during this time that my
              entrepreneurial passion ignited, and I conveyed to Viv my intent
              to start something new and something he was excited to be a part
              of. We discussed my interest in sustainability, explored and
              brainstormed ideas. Our ideation sessions, combined with an open
              offer from a carbon credit trader from Switzerland, helped us
              navigate the complexities of the carbon credit market and the
              sustainability policies of nations globally and that's how Carbon
              Earth was born.

              One thing I liked about him is that, even though he's much better
              than me in many aspects, he never tries to complement me. Instead,
              he reminds me that I‚Äôm already whole in my own way. That approach
              gave me the freedom to grow, learn, and improve myself without
              feeling overshadowed.

              During the same event, I had the opportunity to present Carbon
              Earth at the Pan IIT Tech Expo, where I encountered a startup born
              out of a biotechnology club. They had engineered a bioorganism
              capable of capturing atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ and rapidly converting it
              into limestone. I was blown away when I realized the potential of
              this field to radically transform the world and improve people's
              lives.

              This discovery pushed me to explore not only microbial but also
              terrain and marine mechanisms for CO‚ÇÇ capture. Despite their
              promising impact on the climate, many startups in this sphere
              struggle to scale due to capital constraints. I see an opportunity
              to change that by helping them generate carbon credits for every
              ton of CO‚ÇÇ they mitigate, using tools that quantify CO‚ÇÇ
              sequestration. This realization drives me to delve deeper into
              genetics and systems biology, determined to do whatever it takes
              to turn this concept into reality.
