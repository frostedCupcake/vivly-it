              March 2020. The world was shutting down. Streets were empty, and
              panic was everywhere. The news was flooded with images of
              overwhelmed hospitals and families struggling to get basic
              protective gear. At home, I faced a simple yet frustrating
              problem, getting masks and sanitizers for my family and relatives
              was nearly impossible. Even if they were available, the prices
              were outrageous.
            </li>
            <li>
              Thatâ€™s when a thought struck me: What if I could bypass the
              middlemen and get these essentials directly at wholesale prices?
              But why stop at just my family? What if we could scale this and
              distribute to families in need, hospitals, and frontline workers?
            </li>
            <li>And just like that, my first business idea was born.</li>
            <li>

                We reached out to a healthcare startup that was working on
                pharmaceutical supply chain solutions. We proposed an idea, a
                logistics platform where anyone in the world could request a
                quote for masks, PPE kits, and sanitizers. Within weeks, we
                built the system, ensuring seamless tracking and delivery of
                medical supplies.

                Despite massive logistical challenges trucks getting stuck,
                halted rail services, and unpredictable government regulations,
                we found ways to navigate through the chaos. Working with
                Atrillu, we helped distribute masks, surgical masks, and PPE
                kits by partnering with 3M across Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and
                Tamil Nadu. Every successful delivery meant a hospital getting
                much-needed protective gear or a family staying safe. It was
                intense, exhausting, but deeply fulfilling.

              I met Harshil Karia, who was working at a Swedish company, Proof
              Analytics. He had ambitious ideas for improving their system, but
              their leadership was resistant to change. Frustrated, he left and
              joined us to start Pensive.

            <li className="">
              Pensive was built with a simple but powerful goal: help companies
              allocate their marketing budgets more effectively using data
              analytics. We expanded into Amazonâ€™s ad tracking ecosystem,
              helping brands optimize their ad spends at scale.

                As influencer marketing exploded, we saw a massive inefficiency.
                Companies were constantly hiring and firing teams based on
                fluctuating campaign demands. The process was chaotic and
                inefficient.

                We build a fully automated, enterprise-level influencer

                Sociowash, a Delhi-based agency, to run marketing campaigns for
                their client, Urbanic, for two months.
