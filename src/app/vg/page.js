      "I connected with a friend, who was pursuing computer science at IIIT Delhi. Together, we identified an opportunity to improve security management for gated societies specifically focusing on people ie househelp and driver management within societies. We applied to Y Combinator's Startup School program, completed the course, and implemented our concept in several residential societies in Bangalore. We started onboarding household help, drivers and security guards across four to five societies in the Whitefield area, particularly around Seegehalli, where I used to reside.",

      "Post my time there, I founded Atrillu, a service-based company, but unfortunately the world entered lockdown in March 2020. The news was flooded with images of overwhelmed hospitals and families struggling to get basic protective gear. At home, I faced a frustrating problem, getting masks and sanitizers for my family and relatives was nearly impossible. Even if they were available, the prices were outrageous.",

      "We reached out to a healthcare startup working on pharmaceutical supply chain solutions and proposed a logistics platform allowing anyone globally to request quotes for masks, PPE kits, and sanitizers. Within weeks, we built the system, ensuring seamless tracking and delivery of medical supplies. Despite massive logistical challenges, such as trucks getting stuck, halted rail services, and unpredictable government regulations, we found ways to navigate through the chaos. We distributed medical supplies to numerous hospitals and clinics across Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, ensuring timely deliveries during unprecedented demand. It was intense, exhausting, but deeply fulfilling.",

    description:
      "Around this time, influencer marketing started trending, and after working with Schbang, I noticed several problems that could be addressed through technology. Managing influencer marketing at scale is challenging due to conversations scattered across multiple platforms, leading to confusion, overlooked messages, and difficulty tracking progress. When relationships with creators suffer, campaign reporting to brands becomes complicated, resulting in excessive spreadsheets, incomplete reporting, longer campaign durations, and frustration. This ultimately causes wasted time and lost opportunities. That's why I started building an influencer marketing platform with customizable UI/UX specifically designed for agencies.",

We ran a campign for Urbanic, an Indian fashion brand for two months. We gathered real-time insights, and identified key challenges.
